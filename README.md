```
I am a software developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
Currently studying a degree in systems in UNLa. I really enjoy both designing user interfaces and 
developing server-side code. 
Lately I am specializing in web development.
When I'm not coding, i do other activities like playing guitar and drawing.
